# Rebuilding the Igbo Language
The Igbo Language as of today is a shabby effort that does not properly account for the rich and diverse language/dialects of the Igbo and a few remarkable African languages do suffer the same fate but probably not as much as the Igbo Language. There is a greate need to rebuild the language in a more local and natural way using new information as to ensure the language doesn't go extinct, establish a unified writing system that properly accounts for all the dialects and prepare grounds for a truly central/evolved Igbo language that accounts for all flavours of the language without necessarily promoting one dialect over the other.

## RoadMap #1 (Stakeholder Engagement)

 1. List all academic stakeholders
 2. Contact all academic stakeholders
 3. Engage academic stakeholders via online conferences/webinars
 4. Partner with wililng stakeholders for greater/more effective sensitization

## RoadMap #2 (Proposals)

 1. Review existing literature proposals in rebuilding the Igbo Lanuage
 2. Organize and list existing documents
 3. Solicit for document review from interested individuals
 4. Collate and prepare a conclusive document with ideas/strategies that can be borrowed to determine the best steps forward

## RoadMap #3 (Character Rebuilding)
 1. Decide on the most suitable writing system (alphabetic, syllabic or logographic)
 2. List/get a list of all the existing dialects 
 3. Rebuild ALL syllables/characters from a basic, medium and advanced perspective (Perhaps based on how they can be easily pronounced as a child grows)
 4. Publish Initial draft for private review
 5. Continuous review and improvements
